# Happy Number 

This is a python file made for a college assessment.

It's a python implementation of the happy number algorithm.

A happy number is a positive integer that is defined by the following process:

Take the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (which means it is a happy number), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1 (in that case it is not a happy number).
